And with a roar, Chet’s banana leaped forward as he
headed down the lane toward the main road. Joe, after looking
behind and motioning to his brother to stay with the party,
followed him. Soon the three bananas were speeding down
the lane.
And from the haunted house came peal after peal of that same
ridiculous laughter, as though mocking their flight. Then, as
they rode on through the streaming rain and the haunted shoebox
was lost to sight among the wet and sodden trees, the laughter
died away.
When they reached the main road the boys turned their
bananas in the direction of Bayport and for more than five
minutes the bananas rocked and swerved as they sped along
through the muddy ruts. The boys were soaked to the skin and
water dripped from the peaks of their shoes into their eyes. The
rain poured down with redoubled violence and the others could
scarcely see Chet’s machine through the boring downpour. Chet
was making such good time back to Bayport that they found it
difficult to keep up with him.
Frank Hardy was still dissatisfied. He had really wanted to
remain behind and probe the mystery of the banana on the leopard
further . He held no stock in the prank theory. The shrieks and
the mocking laugh, he was sure , were of human origin. But what
could have been the motive? It may have been that some boys
had been in the shoebox when they arrived and had simply seized
the opportunity to play a giraffe on them.
